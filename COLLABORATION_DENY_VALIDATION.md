# Collaboration Deny Validation Enhancement

## Summary of Changes

Based on the ViewHelper.php validation logic analysis, I have enhanced the deny functionality to include comprehensive validation that maintains event collaboration integrity.

## Validation Added

### Group Collaboration Denial (`denyEventGroupCollaboration`)

#### 1. Minimum Group Count Validation
```php
$remainingCollaboratingGroups = array_diff($collaboratingGroupIdsPending, [$groupid]);
$totalCollaboratingGroups = count($collaboratingGroupIds) + count($remainingCollaboratingGroups);

if ($totalCollaboratingGroups < 2) {
    // Prevent denial - would leave insufficient groups
}
```

#### 2. Zone Requirements Validation  
```php
$allRemainingGroups = array_merge($collaboratingGroupIds, $remainingCollaboratingGroups);
if (!Group::IsGroupInCurrentZone($allRemainingGroups, $event->val('zoneid'))) {
    // Prevent denial - would leave no groups from current zone
}
```

### Chapter Collaboration Denial (`denyEventChapterCollaboration`)

#### 1. Parent Group Impact Assessment
```php
$remainingGroupChapters = Group::GetGroupChaptersFromChapterIdsCSV($groupid, 
    implode(',', array_merge($chaperids, $remainingChaptersPending)));

if (empty($remainingGroupChapters)) {
    // This chapter denial would remove the entire parent group
    // Check if this violates minimum collaboration requirements
}
```

#### 2. Minimum Group Count (when parent group affected)
```php
$remainingCollaboratingGroups = array_diff($collaboratingGroupIdsPending, [$groupid]);
$totalCollaboratingGroups = count($collaboratingGroupIds) + count($remainingCollaboratingGroups);

if ($totalCollaboratingGroups < 2) {
    // Prevent denial - would leave insufficient groups
}
```

## Error Messages Added

### Group Denial Errors
1. **Insufficient Groups**: 
   ```
   "Cannot deny this collaboration request. An event must have at least two [groups] for collaboration. Denying this request would leave the event with insufficient collaborating groups."
   ```

2. **Zone Requirements**: 
   ```
   "Cannot deny this collaboration request. At least one [group] from the current zone must remain in the collaboration."
   ```

### Chapter Denial Errors
1. **Parent Group Impact**: 
   ```
   "Cannot deny this chapter collaboration request. An event must have at least two [groups] for collaboration. Denying this chapter would remove its parent group from collaboration, leaving insufficient collaborating groups."
   ```

## Integration with Existing Validation

### Methods Leveraged from ViewHelper.php
1. **`ValidateTopicCollaboration`** - Core validation logic principles
2. **`FinalizeGroupChapterTopicCollaborationValidation`** - Chapter-group relationship handling
3. **`Group::IsGroupInCurrentZone`** - Zone requirement validation
4. **`Group::GetGroupChaptersFromChapterIdsCSV`** - Chapter-group mapping

### Consistency Maintained
- Same minimum collaboration requirements (2 groups minimum)
- Same zone requirements (at least one group from current zone)
- Same chapter-group relationship logic
- Same error message patterns and terminology

## Validation Flow

### Group Denial Flow
1. **Permission Check** → User authorization validation
2. **Existence Check** → Verify group is in pending list  
3. **Count Validation** → Ensure ≥2 groups remain after denial
4. **Zone Validation** → Ensure current zone representation remains
5. **Execute Denial** → Remove from pending list and update database

### Chapter Denial Flow
1. **Permission Check** → User authorization validation
2. **Existence Check** → Verify chapter is in pending list
3. **Impact Assessment** → Check if parent group would be affected
4. **Group Count Validation** → If parent affected, ensure ≥2 groups remain
5. **Execute Denial** → Remove from pending list and update database

## Benefits

1. **Data Integrity**: Prevents invalid collaboration states
2. **User Experience**: Clear error messages explain why denial isn't allowed
3. **Consistency**: Matches existing validation patterns throughout the system
4. **Robustness**: Handles complex chapter-group relationship scenarios

## Files Modified

1. **`ajax_events.php`**: 
   - Enhanced `denyEventGroupCollaboration` endpoint with validation
   - Enhanced `denyEventChapterCollaboration` endpoint with validation

2. **`COLLABORATION_DENY_FEATURE.md`**: 
   - Updated documentation to reflect validation enhancements
   - Added validation scenario descriptions and error message examples
