~ SETUP ~
Folder ./locales contains 2 files:
    1. app_locals.json
    2. app_locales_strings.php

Frontend developer (Flutter Developer) will provide app_locals.json file with key and value in defalut language i.e. english.

All the values of app_locals.json needs to be mapped with gettext() method on app_locales_strings.php file by backend developer and complile with POEdit tool.

~ API ~
For app localizatioin there are 2 api.
1. getAvailableLanguages
2. getLocalization

getAvailableLanguages api will provide available languages for translation. 
getLocalization need language code e.g. for japanese -  ja if needs japanese localizatioin.

~ USE ~

getLocalization need to be called everytime before landing on home page. Pick the language code from defaultLanguage key of users data object.


~ UPDATE ~

If frontend add new translation key and value on app_locals.json file, backend developer need to replase old app_locals.json  with new one and map new value with gettext() method on app_locales_strings.php file.
